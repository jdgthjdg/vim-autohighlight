Autohighlight - Highlight the word under the cursor
===================================================

What does it do?
----------------
Move the cursor over some word. Vim will highlight that word and all other occurrences of that word.


Wait, what? Why?
----------------
Suppose you are looking at some source code and try to grasp the structure. You
will need to get an idea where else variables, functions or whatever you are
looking at are used. You could search for them but for a quick glance at some
code, this is rather tedious. Instead, just have Vim highlight whatever is
under the cursor. As an added bonus, this way will not interfere with normal
search operation.


How do I use it?
----------------
1. Install it using your favorite plugin manager, e.g. `Plug 'mox-mox/vim-authighlight'` for vim-plug.
2. Open a file, move the cursor over some word.
